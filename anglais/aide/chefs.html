<P>Scouts search this site (they have to locate the What

work either in teams, with a partner or individually. Leaders
could organize a competition between the different teams
(which patrol can finish first, or get the most correct
answers).</P>
<P>The Missing Words can be played on-line, or on paper. If
Scouts are going to play on paper, the What is a Culture of
Peace must also be printed and distributed. On line: When
Scouts are happy with their proposal, they click
'Let's try!'. A few seconds later they will know their score.
At any time they can delete their proposal and start again
from scratch by clicking on 'Ooooops!'</P>

Part I -- On-line Game<BR>
<UL><P>
Scouts click on the key that applies to each
Activity. If there is any debate by the Scout or
his/her partner about which of the 8 keys best
applies, the point is discussed for 1 minute then
noted on paper. The Scouts in pairs or teams decide
if there is any subject that they want to raise in
the large unit discussion. When all the Scouts have
finished the activity they are ready for Part II of
this game.<BR>
</P></UL>
Part II -- On-line and Off-line Game<BR>
<UL><P>
The entire Scout group comes together. The Leader
gives Scouts an opportunity to ask questions in
connection with the game. Appoint a Secretary to take
notes of the discussion. Each team presents their
answers to the Activity cards. Each team also
presents the points, which were debated in their team
discussion. The entire unit discusses the differences
in the opinions brought out by the unit. On line:
When Scouts are happy with their proposal, they click

</P></UL>
Conclusion:<BR>
<UL><P>
Depending on the subjects raised in the group
discussion, the leader may wish to stress a
particular point (e.g. one of the 8 keys for further
research). Or the Scout group can move on to becoming
Reporters for Peace at the next meeting. An e-mail
or letter with the different points discussed
(gathered from the notes of the Secretary) is sent to
the Site for publication in the Peace Journal.

<LI> Begin with a group discussion of the 8 keys of a Culture
of Peace focusing on the keys that the Scouts think might
need to be promoted in actions which they have undertaken as
part of their Scouting activities in the community. For
example, Scouts might discuss activities for the environment
such as recycling drives they have undertaken or a recent
movie they have seen. Make a list of these. Using the latter
example, the list could read: the sustainable human
development, the environment solidarity, etc. The entire
Scout group should come to a consensus on the topic of the
report. Note the following restrictions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> the action must be related to the 8 keys of
Peace.
<LI> the action must be taken within your own
community.
<LI> the action must not conflict with one of the 8
keys.
</UL><BR>
<BR>
<LI> Scouts go into patrols or teams of about 4 to discuss
what they would like include in the report. In particular the
question of the way the 8 keys are reflected should be
discussed and each team should come up with their own
evaluation of the 8 keys for the report. Someone in the group
notes the evaluations as well as any conflicts in opinion,
which arise during the discussion. Suggested time: 15
minutes.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The entire Scout group comes together. One Scout is
appointed secretary. The Scout Leader gives Scouts an
opportunity to ask questions in connection with the activity.
The group discusses what to put on the form. Each team
presents their answers and points, which were debated in
their discussion. The entire group discusses the differences
in the opinions and comes to a consensus as a unit on the
contents of their report.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion:<BR>
The Secretary fills out the form and sends it to the Site by
e-mail, by fax or by lmail. A selection of the best reports
will be published in the Peace Journal. To give the
possibility to the editorial team of the Journal to
communicate with your local Scout group, don't forget to give
an e-mail address, a fax number or a postal address.
