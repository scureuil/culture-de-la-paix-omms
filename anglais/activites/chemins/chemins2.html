<P ALIGN=LEFT>How do we confront the kind of situation where many people
have to take a decision? Without doubt it is difficult as each one defends
their particular interests. Nowadays, there are frequent cases where the
progress of some means a step backwards for others, and damage to their
quality of life.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>With this activity, we want you and your Troop to become familiar
with these types of problem in an entertaining manner. It is a game whose
objective is for the participants to adopt a role within a fictitious situation,
forcing them to discuss themes that affect the life of the whole community
and to make decisions accordingly.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In the first place, they have to imagine the following: The
authorities of a country have decided to build a highway that has to pass
through a beautiful small town. How do you think its inhabitants feel? They
would probably have a different appreciation of it if they were to think
of the hundreds of people who need the highway.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Before the activity</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>To prepare this game, the adults in charge should follow these
steps:<BR>
<TABLE WIDTH="414" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT="84">
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="9%" VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000000">1.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="91%" VALIGN="TOP"><P>According to the number of participants, they have to make the character
cards &quot;role player&quot; and &quot;hinderer&quot; which appear in <A
HREF="#455611">Appendix 1</A>. Remember that these cards should have a drawing
of the person, and on the other side the necessary information that characterises
him or her.</P>

<P>The number of players can be between 23 and 48 persons. Before initiating
the activity, we suggest that you make the following distribution: 70% get
the &quot;role player&quot; cards, 15% &quot;hinderer&quot; cards, and the
remaining 15% do not receive cards as they will belong to the &quot;uncommitted&quot;
group.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000000">2.</FONT></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Those in charge have to prepare a big copy of the map of Valle Verde and
the highway project as shown in <A HREF="#459881">Figure 1</A>. This street
map should be in view of all Scouts during the game.</TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000000">3.</FONT></TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000000">4.</FONT></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>One week before the activity, the adults in charge should ask the players
for complementary information. This involves researching the following:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0">The cost of each Km of a highway</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%">In addition, the activity leader asks the youngsters to bring clothes and
accessories to dress up on the day of the game.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Presentation</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The entire Troop meets to discuss the game. For the activity
to be successful, the activity leader explains to the scouts that they should
put a lot of effort into it and try to imagine themselves in the role they
will be playing.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then the leader goes on to talk about the dilemma caused by
the results of economic and industrial progress - that they are not always
compatible with peace and protection of the environment. For example, the
car allows us to move quickly and comfortably from one place to another,
but its engine contaminates the air with toxic gases.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Often one has to sacrifice the well-being of the minority
in order to satisfy the wishes of the majority. This occurs in the building
of a hydro-electric plant; if a lot of people are going to enjoy the benefits
of it, lot of woods and villages will be condemned to be left under water.</P>

<TD WIDTH="90%" VALIGN="TOP">The activity leader asks every participant to imagine living in Valle Verde,
a beautiful little village where the new highway, M19, is planned to pass
through. A lot of the inhabitants oppose the project, but there are also
those who see this as their opportunity to improve the current situation.
Between them all they have to decide on the future of Valle Verde.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="10%" HEIGHT="17" VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#000000">2.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="90%" VALIGN="TOP">To start the game, those in charge display the map and hand out a copy of
the paper &quot;The Star&quot; to each player. Here the dilemma facing the
village is described. Opinions on the matter are varied and a meeting has
been arranged in order to air the different points of view and analyse all
the consequences.</TD></TR>

in such a way that as many as possible obtain a role. The &quot;hinderer&quot;
cards should be given to the participants who do not have a role. If necessary,
those in charge can invent and add further cards.<BR CLEAR="ALL">The youngsters
who do not get any cards, form part of the &quot;uncommitted&quot;group.
At the public meeting, the factions in the conflict will try to win their
support. It is hoped that these new players will contribute new data thanks
to the previous research during the week.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="90%" VALIGN="TOP">The activity leader tells all the participants to take time to prepare for
the public meeting. This is the time to study the roles, creating the arguments
to be used in the subsequent discussion. Those in charge suggest that the
Scouts observe the map and find out where the residential, industrial and
commercial sectors are in Valle Verde. Their locations are of key importance
and can be used as strong arguments against or in favour of the highway.<BR

best way of characterising their role, making use of all possible accessories
brought from home.</TD></TR>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">The meeting will be led by Councillor Fuentes, who wants the desires of
the inhabitants of Valle Verde to be the most important factor in making
the decision. Therefore, he needs to know what position they will adopt
before the Provincial Council (the regional authority) and the Minister
(the national authority). The activity leader can take the role of Councillor
Fuentes if the situation demands it. The important thing is that each player
manages to express his or her idea.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;7.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="90%">Councillor Fuentes initiates the public meeting. One by one the inhabitants
start to explain their arguments. The debate will probably be rather heated
at times and it is the obligation of the president to control the discussion.
After all have spoken their minds, Councillor Fuentes will suggest a vote
that will decide the future of the highway project. Only the people who
live in Valle Verde have the right to vote! After the result is declared,
the president will close the meeting.</TD></TR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">8. To finalise the game the activity leader asks each
patrol to write an article about the public meeting for &quot;THE STAR&quot;.
They can also ask for a recorded report on tape for the local radio of Valle
Verde.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>9. The articles are read at the following Troop meeting. After
the exhibitions, the adults in charge invite the Scouts to comment on the
activity. The objective is for every participant to have the opportunity
to express what they felt whilst interpreting their role.<BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>We hope the game has been useful in teaching you how to confront
similar problems such as the one presented in &quot;The highway of Valle
Verde&quot;. Remember that the solution will always be fairer if all make
an effort to step in the other people's shoes.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The following are examples of cards that can be used to define
roles in this simulation game. They are not rigid and it is possible to
create other personalities with particular interests, in favour or against
the highway project. Even though the majority of the content is applied
to a certain type of community (Western European), it can easily be adapted
to any neighbourhood. If the Troop wishes to adapt the game, the adults
in charge should include typical personalities of the village, the region
or the country where they live.</P>

the great noise problem they have due to the heavy trucks in the centre
of the community. Father Su&aacute;rez, the local priest, said that the
noise and the vibration were causing considerable damage to the church right
by the principal highway. Nevertheless, a local resident who also lives
near the A74, Mrs. &quot;Hard hand&quot; Duran, as her loved ones call her,
says: &quot;I have lived here all my life and the traffic noise has never
bothered me&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>I DO NOT WANT TO MOVE<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Mrs. Duran continues saying: &quot;They have told
me that my house will be demolished if they build the new highway, but they
will do that over my dead body. I will stay here until they force me away&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>DANGEROUS CROSSING<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Certainly hard words, but there seems to be a whole
current of opinion in the village which is in favour of the highway.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP"><P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mrs. P&eacute;rez, who lives in Municipal property, spoke
to me about her fears about her children who have to cross the A74 twice
daily, to and from school. She said: &quot;In that highway 5 kids were run
over last year and the whole world knows about the awful death of young
Jose L&oacute;pez some years ago&quot;. Mrs. Montes, director of the primary
school of the village, shares these fears, although she agrees almost against
her will that people will be able to go the Capital City much cheaper with
the new highway.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>COMMUTERS<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Some people of Valle Verde travel every day to
the small town of Moreno and one of them, Mr Pedro Rosas, energetically
expressed his views on the travellers' situation in Valle Verde. &quot;The

ecological group &quot;Friends of the Earth&quot; swore to combat the highway
with their lives, and the organisation Society Valle Verde has given them
their support in the struggle. They wish to protect the beautiful rural
surroundings that they consider will be ruined by the new highway. But the
users of the highway and other industrial interests are also getting organised
in support of the new highway. The Group for Road Development believes that
the highway is essential to relieve Valle Verde from traffic and to promote
and develop commercial ties with the city of Esmeralda. The highway constructors,
who plan to send their representatives to the meeting of Councillor Fuentes,
support them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All these interest groups, with their data and numbers

&quot;The M19 is a symbol of everything that is wrong with national policy
on transport. It will cost millions of dollars, it will take up thousands
of km2 of fertile agricultural land and it will kill the rail system which
until now has worked perfectly well, and which according to us can be used
even better. With oil running out, we must get away from cars and cultivate
our food a little better. This highway takes us in a wrong direction and
will mean less money being invested in public transport, which half of the
population without cars depends upon. The highway protectors believe that
they will save Valle Verde, but experience proves that traffic expands until
there is no more space. We want real solutions for the traffic problems,
planning in a way that people will not need to travel that much.&quot;<BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are many problems that we can only solve with the help
of others, but this is not always easy to do as we all have different personalities
which react in different ways depending on the situation. In the 19th World
Scout Jamboree, thousands of youngsters from all over the world will meet
to have fun and at the same time resolve problems together. When faced with
awkward challenges, finding forms of communicating to overcome cultural
and historical differences is of the greatest importance.<BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The activity we hereby present to you takes place in the warm
waters of the Caribbean, where the Troop will transform itself into a <B>CREW
OF PIRATES</B> who are looking for the greatest treasure ever to be seen
by man.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>With this game we hope that the Patrols will, in an entertaining
manner, come to understand the value of co-operation.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Before the activity</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The following materials are required for preparation:</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> A piece of thick card or cardboard 120 cm long and
60 cm wide</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Drawing and colouring materials such as felt-tip pens,
crayons, paints, etc</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> 4 big envelopes</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> 32 smaller envelopes</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Copies of Appendices <A HREF="#477202">1</A> and <A
HREF="#485206">2</A> for all observers and Patrols participating</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> One flipchart and marker pens</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> One notebook for each observer</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Game</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>1. To begin, the adults in charge have to decide what the
treasure should be. Since it is a game of co-operation, we suggest that
the treasure be of symbolic value, and something which reinforces the Troop's
identity and sense of belonging. They must then find a suitable hiding place.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>2. The leaders design a treasure map setting real geographical
elements in a fantasy situation, for example an island surrounded by coral
reefs, sharks and sunken boats. Whatever the case, the important thing is
that the location of the treasure be accurately indicated. This treasure
map is to be drawn on the 120 by 60 cm piece of card.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>3. When the map is ready, it must be turned over and two straight
lines drawn in the form of a cross on the blank side, thus dividing it into
four equal rectangles each 60 cm by 30 cm, as shown in <A HREF="#474149">Figure
1</A>. <B>The basic outline of the map must be copied onto each of these
four rectangles. </B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>4. Each of these basic outlines must then be divided into
eight equal squares 15 by 15 cm, and each of those divided into three pieces.
The corresponding letter (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, or k) must be written
in pencil on each of these pieces. Now with the basic model exactly reproduced
on the four rectangular pieces, the treasure map should have 96 pieces,
as observed in <A HREF="#474149">Figure 1</A><FONT COLOR="#330099">.</FONT><A

<P><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/puzzle.gif" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="169" ALIGN="TOP" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P ALIGN=LEFT>5. The next step is to repeat the following procedure for
each of the rectangles:</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The 24 pieces are cut out, ensuring that all parts
of the same size are marked with the same letter.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Eight small envelopes are marked with the letters A,
B, C, D, E, F, G and H, and the three pieces placed inside each one according
to the instructions in the box below. NOTE: Before a piece is placed in
its envelope, whatever is written on it must be erased and in the same place
the letter of the envelope it belongs to must be written.</P>

<IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"> Now the eight small envelopes are placed inside one of the big envelopes.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Once each of the four rectangles has been correctly cut up
and packaged, the adults in charge should have in their hands four big envelopes
which each contain eight envelopes (<B>A, B, C, D, E, F, G</B> and <B>H</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/hoyo.gif" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="168" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B>Presentation of the game</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The activity leader explains to the Patrols that they have
come to the warm waters of the Caribbean where, according to an ancient
legend, one of the greatest treasures known to man is still hidden. The
Troop has magically transformed itself into the crew of a pirate ship which
is looking for the treasure. An old sailor, in return for a number of barrels
of rum, has given them a map which indicates where the valuable treasure
lies. But there is a problem: with the passing of time, the map has broken
into many little pieces and can't be deciphered unless the pieces are put
together again.<BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>To succeed in doing this, the crew will have to approach the
task as a team, combining the concentration and ingenuity of all the pirates.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Without entering into details of the rules the leader explains
that the game is not a test of physical strength or skill of the individual,
but aims to develop each person's capacity for co-operation.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>First part of the game</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The game is designed for four Patrols. Each group sits
in a circle out of view of the others, and must appoint an observer.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The Troop does nothing while the observers go to the
adults in charge, each to be given two copies of <A HREF="#477202">Appendix
1</A><FONT COLOR="#330099"> </FONT>and one big envelope containing the eight
smaller envelopes marked <B>A, B, C, D, E, F, G</B> and<B> H. </B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The observers should be given enough time to read the instructions
and to completely familiarise themselves with them. Time should also be
allowed to answer questions and resolve any doubts that might exist.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The observer has two functions: to keep watch over the game
so that the rules are correctly followed and to monitor the behaviour of
the participants.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The observers reintegrate themselves into their respective
Patrols. The activity leader asks them to hand out the instructions to the
Patrols and one of the members reads them out. All questions should be dealt
with at this stage. When all are clear about the rules, each observer pulls
out the small envelopes from the big one, and hands out one to each of the
Patrol members.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE: This game is made for Patrols of 9 members, but it can
easily be adapted if this is not the case. If there are not enough envelopes
for everyone, they will have to be shared by pairs or small groups, as decided
by the Patrol. If the other way around, and there are too many envelopes,
the Patrol can distribute extra pieces to each member.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> After a signal, each person opens his or her envelope
and lays out the three pieces face down, without the drawing of the map
showing.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The observer must make sure that all members of the Patrol
can see the 24 pieces and that none of them are face up, but he should not
intervene in the game.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>Suggested duration: 30 minutes.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> As <A HREF="#477202">Appendix 1</A> suggests, each
Patrol should form eight perfect squares of equal dimensions (15 by 15 cm).
As soon as one of the Patrols has finished, they should stand up and wait
for the rest of the Troop to finish.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> When all the Patrols have finished their jigsaw, the
leader signals that they can turn over all the pieces and study the drawing.
Again all Patrols should have finished before the game continues. Then,
the leader checks that each group has completed only a section of the treasure
map, therefore making it obvious that to eventually complete the whole map
they will need to co-operate.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The activity leader invites the Patrols to assemble
the pieces and at last form the map. When it is ready, all pirate crews
go off in search of the lost treasure. It is important to prevent this from
becoming a race to find the treasure first. The focus of the activity should
be that the discovery of the treasure will be a triumph for the whole Troop.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Second part of the game</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The Patrols meet again separately, and the activity
leader hands out a copy of the questionnaire <A HREF="#485206">(Appendix
2)</A> to each observer and Patrol. These questions are useful in promoting
a discussion that should be centred on what the participants feel about
the behaviour of the rest. It is important that everyone gives their opinion.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>Suggested duration: 15 to 20 minutes.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../../../commun/images/chemins/punto.gif" WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The entire Troop meets, and the activity leader asks
for volunteers to comment on what they have learned in the activity. If
there is a flipchart, their views can perhaps be listed. It might also be
interesting to ask the participants to compare the game with a personal
experience of co-operation or an occasion when co-operation would have helped.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>We hope that this workshop has been useful in allowing an
understanding of the importance of our attitudes, and how they can either
contribute to or hinder a solution.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=-1>This activity has been collected and adapted
from the &quot;Manual and Book of Resources of Enabling for Popular Participation&quot;
published by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United
Nations.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PATROL</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>You have been given eight envelopes which contain several
pieces of cardboard which can be pieced together to form squares. When the
signal is given, one envelope should be handed out to each member of the
Patrol.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>NOTE: If there are not enough envelopes, the Patrol will have
to allocate them to pairs or teams rather than to individuals. If there
are more envelopes than players, the leftover pieces should be taken out
and distributed between everyone.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Before any other signal, each of you should <B>put your three
pieces face down in front of you</B>, so that the only thing showing is
the letter which indicates the envelope it corresponds to. The 24 pieces
should be in full view of everyone.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then each one of you tries to form a square. However, there
are certain rules which should be followed:<BR>
